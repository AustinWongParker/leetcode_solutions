### Austin Wong-Parker's Leetcode Solutions
These are my leetcode solutions from studying for upcoming interviews. I primarily used the Blind 75 list with Neetcode explanation in Python.

In each directory, you will find my python solution and my whiteboard diagram I drew. 

To ensure I challenge myself, I usually set a timer for the following:\
**Easy - 30mins**\
**Medium - 40mins**\
**Hard - 50mins**
